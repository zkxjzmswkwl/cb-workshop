# wtf are pointers?
Pointers exist in many languages, but for brevity's sake, we'll concern ourselves with the syntax and behavior of pointers as they are in C/C++.

Pointers do exactly what you'd think, they **point**.

```
--------------------------
| Addr | Value           |
--------------------------
| 0x0  | 0x539           |
| 0x4  | 0x0             |
| 0x8  | 0x4             |
| 0xC  | 0x32            |
| 0x10 | p               |
| 0x11 | o               |
| 0x12 | i               |
| 0x13 | n               |
| 0x14 | t               |
| 0x15 | e               |
| 0x16 | r               |
| 0x17 | \0              |
--------------------------
```

C++:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
// This is pseudo-code. This won't actually compile and behave exactly as depicted here.

// For the sake of simplicity, for now, we'll assume this assigns a pointer to
// the 0x0 row in the table above.
//
// the * denotes that this is a pointer.
int* pointer = 0x0;

// So, we have a pointer that is *pointing* to the memory address 0x0.
// In our table, we can see that the value at 0x0 is hex 0x539, or 1337 in decimal.
// How can we access the value from this pointer?
std::cout << pointer << "\n";
// This would output 0x0, not 0x539 or 1337. Why?
// Because the value of a pointer is that of the memory address it points to, not what's stored at that address.
// If we want to get the value of what's stored at 0x0 from `int* pointer = 0x0;`, we need to dereference the pointer.
//
// Which looks like this
std::cout << *pointer << "\n";
// This would output 1337.
// On declaration, <type>*, tells the compiler that this variable POINTS to a memory address which contains a value of <type>.
// In our case, that's int. int* pointer is essentially telling the compiler:
//  "Hey, the variable `pointer` is to be considered a pointer to a memory address which contains an integer."
//
// On reference to that variable, *pointer denotes that we want the value at the memory address the pointer is pointing to.
```

> So, what's the point of pointers? Why do they exist?

Pointers exist because they provide an easy way to point to structures in memory.

- On x86, the size of a pointer is 4 bytes, 0x4.
- On x64, the size of a pointer is 8 bytes, 0x8.

The size of a pointer is unchanging, aside from the 4 byte difference depending on cpu architecture (x86, x64). We can use pointers to point to a large structure in memory, a structure of any size, and that pointer will still be `0x4` or `0x8` bytes respectively.

Say we have a pointer to a large list of `Player` objects. A `Player` object is `0x800` bytes in size, and this list could have any number of players within it. Say it has 20 players. `0x800 * 20` = `0x10000`

If we want to pass that list of players into a function that iterates over each player in the list to find one of a specific username, without a pointer, we'd be **copying** `0x10000` bytes each time that function is called. That takes time to do, and there's no reason to do so. The list of players already exists, we have a pointer to it. So why should we copy it? We shouldn't. We can instead use a pointer and pass the pointer to that function instead. Meaning we are only copying `0x4` or `0x8` bytes, not `0x10000`.

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

// `std::vector` in C++ is similar to an `ArrayList` in Java or a simple list in Python.
// Similar being the key word here. They are not 1:1 in behavior, but for the sake of this example, they are.
std::vector<Player> players;
std::vector<Player>* playersPtr;

filterByUsername(players);      // BAD! COPIES THE ENTIRE OBJECT (0x10000 BYTES)
filterByUsername(playersPtr);   // GOOD! 
```

Now, this would of course mean that the fictitious function `filterByUsername` needs to expect a pointer to `std::vector<Player>`, and not a regular `std::vector<Player>` object. So it'd look something like

`Player filterByUsername(std::vector<Player>* players, std::string usernameToFind)`

Within that function, you'd then need to dereference that pointer in order to access the data being pointed to. In our case, that's a list of `Player` objects.

```cpp
Player filterByUsername(std::vector<Player>* players, std::string usernameToFind) {
    //              *players = derefence
    for (Player p : *players) {
        if (p.username == usernameToFind) {
            return p;
        }
    }
    // This wouldn't compile because in the event that no player by that name exists, nothing is returned.
}
```

In a real-world scenario you'd be hard-pressed to find an `std::vector<Player>` within a game. You will however come across `std::vector<Player*>`. Which is a list of pointers to `Player` objects.

Above we calculated that with the `Player` object having a size of `0x800` bytes, and the list contains 20 players, `0x800 * 20` = `0x10000`. But if instead of `std::vector<Player>` we have `std::vector<Player*>`, the calculation is no longer `0x800 * 20` = `0x10000`, but instead `0x8 * 20` = `0x100`.

Here's how we would adapt our `filterByUsername` function for a list of `Player` pointers, rather than a pointer to a list of `Player` objects.

```cpp
Player filterByUsername(std::vector<Player*> players, std::string usernameToFind) {
    //              *players = derefence
    for (Player* p : players) {
        // Notice the -> instead of .
        // `->` is shorthand for *p.username in this case.
        // `->` is used to access fields of an object pointed to by a pointer. 
        // `->` lets us access fields without having to manually dereference *and then* access a field. It does both.
        if (p->username == usernameToFind) {
            return *p;  // ! This is copying the full 0x800 size of the Player object.
                        // Ideally, we'd be returning a pointer to the Player object.
        }
    }
    // This wouldn't compile because in the event that no player by that name exists, nothing is returned.
}
```


Languages like Java/C# do all this for you under the hood. More on that later.
